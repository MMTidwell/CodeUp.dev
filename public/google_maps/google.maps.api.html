<!--
√ - generate a map that shows the city with your fav restaurant using geocoding
√ - redraw the map of the above location at zoom levels 5, 15, 20
√ - create a marker on the location of fav restaurant and adjust the zoom to allow for best viewing distance
√ - create an info window with the name of said restaurant
√ - zoom in and verify that you have id the location (double check with google)

Bonuses
- info windows can contain basic HTML, not just plain text. Add some info about restaurant to the info window like why you like it....
- research google maps events, make sure that the info doesn't display until marker is clicked
- add a drop animation to the marker when the page first loads
- re-factor your code to display at least 3 fav restaurants with info about each. You will most likely need a .forEach() instead of a for loop
- replace the generic marker icon with an image that is more appropriate for each restaurant
